# [M2Eclipse](http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/) Extensions #
A project for housing extensions for [M2Eclipse](http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/) (Maven Integration for Eclipse). By extensions we mean _project configurators_ for the m2eclipse Eclipse plugin.

# WARNING #
  * You need m2eclipse 0.10.0 to use this. At this point, no support for earlier versions of m2e is planned.
  * **Uninstall** if you have any of Findbugs, Checkstyle or PMD m2eclipse project configurators in your installation. If you **don't** then you are good to go.

  * You need **eclipse-cs**, **Findbugs Eclipse** and **PMD Eclipse** plugins installed. Please see the installation page for details and links to the update site.
