## Introduction ##
Credit where credit is due.

## m2eclipse team ##
<p>
The m2eclipse team has done an excellent job with close to native integration with Eclipse for Maven2<br>
projects as possible. Also the extensions API has been really useful to extend the functionality.<br>

## Project Configurator Page ##
<p>
This extensions would not be possible without some examples on the <a href='http://docs.codehaus.org/display/M2ECLIPSE/ProjectConfigurator+contributor+guide'>Project Configurator</a>
page. The code samples from the <a href='https://platina.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/platina/eclipse/checkstyle/trunk/'>Checkstyle</a> and <a href='https://pmd.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pmd/branches/pmd-eclipse-plugin/4.2.x/m2eclipse/'>PMD</a> were especially useful to kick start this project.<br>
